# Commit and PR Standards

## Commit style
1. Use scoped imperative summary:
   - `backend: extract auth module usecase`
   - `docs: add ADR for modular backend`
2. Keep commits cohesive to one intent.

## PR style
1. Include summary, rationale, validation evidence.
2. Mention migration/rollback concerns when relevant.
3. Update docs/tasks with implementation status.
