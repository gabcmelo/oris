# Task Evidence Logs

This folder stores evidence, screenshots, command outputs, and other artifacts related to task execution.

## Purpose
- Record validation commands and their outputs
- Store screenshots demonstrating implemented features  
- Keep integration test results
- Document smoke test executions
- Archive any other evidence needed for task completion

## Organization
Evidence files should be named with the task ID for easy reference:
- `0011-backend-build-output.txt`
- `0015-security-test-results.md`
- `0023-mvp-smoke-test.png`

## When to add evidence
- Before marking a task as DONE
- When validation commands are executed
- When manual testing demonstrates acceptance criteria
- When code review requires additional context
